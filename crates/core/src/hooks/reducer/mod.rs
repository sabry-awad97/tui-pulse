/// React-style useReducer hook for complex state management
///
/// This hook provides a way to manage complex state logic using a reducer function,
/// similar to React's useReducer hook. It's particularly useful when you have complex
/// state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on
/// the previous one.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `reducer` - A function that takes the current state and an action, returning new state
/// * `initial_state` - The initial state value
///
/// # Returns
///
/// A tuple containing:
/// * `ReducerStateHandle<S>` - Handle for accessing the current state
/// * `DispatchFn<A>` - Function for dispatching actions to update state
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ## Simple Counter with Actions
/// ```rust,no_run
/// # use pulse_core::hooks::reducer::use_reducer;
/// #[derive(Clone)]
/// enum CounterAction {
///     Increment,
///     Decrement,
///     Reset,
///     SetValue(i32),
/// }
///
/// fn counter_reducer(state: i32, action: CounterAction) -> i32 {
///     match action {
///         CounterAction::Increment => state + 1,
///         CounterAction::Decrement => state - 1,
///         CounterAction::Reset => 0,
///         CounterAction::SetValue(value) => value,
///     }
/// }
///
/// // Example usage in a component context
/// let (state, dispatch) = use_reducer(counter_reducer, 0);
/// let count = state.get();
/// // count is now 0
///
/// dispatch.call(CounterAction::Increment);
/// // In a real component, this would trigger a re-render
/// // and the state would be updated
/// ```
///
/// ## Complex State Management
/// ```rust,no_run
/// # use pulse_core::hooks::reducer::use_reducer;
/// #[derive(Clone)]
/// struct TodoState {
///     todos: Vec<Todo>,
///     filter: Filter,
///     next_id: u32,
/// }
///
/// #[derive(Clone)]
/// struct Todo {
///     id: u32,
///     text: String,
///     completed: bool,
/// }
///
/// #[derive(Clone)]

///     All,
///     Active,

///     AddTodo(String),
///     ToggleTodo(u32),
///     RemoveTodo(u32),
///     SetFilter(Filter),
///     ClearCompleted,
/// }
///
/// fn todo_reducer(state: TodoState, action: TodoAction) -> TodoState {
///     match action {
///         TodoAction::AddTodo(text) => TodoState {
///             todos: {
///                 let mut todos = state.todos;
///                 todos.push(Todo {
///                     id: state.next_id,
///                     text,
///                     completed: false,
///                 });
///                 todos
///             },
///             next_id: state.next_id + 1,
///             ..state
///         },
///         TodoAction::ToggleTodo(id) => TodoState {
///             todos: state.todos.into_iter().map(|mut todo| {
///                 if todo.id == id {
///                     todo.completed = !todo.completed;
///                 }
///                 todo
///             }).collect(),
///             ..state
///         },
///         _ => state, // Handle other actions
///     }
/// }
///
/// // Example usage in a component context
/// let initial_state = TodoState {
///     todos: vec![],
///     filter: Filter::All,
///     next_id: 1,
/// };
///
/// let (state, dispatch) = use_reducer(todo_reducer, initial_state);
/// // state.get().todos.len() is now 0
///
/// dispatch.call(TodoAction::AddTodo("Learn Rust".to_string()));
/// // In a real component, this would trigger a re-render
/// ```
///
/// # Thread Safety
///
/// The returned state handle and dispatch function are both thread-safe and can be
/// safely shared across async tasks.
///
/// # Performance Notes
///
/// - State reads are optimized using RwLock for concurrent access
/// - State updates are atomic and thread-safe
/// - The reducer function should be pure (no side effects)
/// - State transitions are immutable - the reducer should return new state
